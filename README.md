# What is this
Dark theme for HackerNews. That's it. Doesn't change the layout, spacing, font sizes or anything else. Just the palette. Enjoy.

Note: requires your browser to set the `prefers-color-scheme: dark` property. This is done automatically if you are on a modern browser and your OS is set to "Night Mode" or similar.

# Installation
With the [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) extension installed on your browser, just go to the raw `hn-dark-mode.user.css` [URL](https://github.com/andrecarini/hn-dark-mode/raw/refs/heads/main/hn-dark-mode.user.css) and you will be prompted for installing the stylesheet.
